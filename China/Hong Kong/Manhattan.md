# Manhattan (Hong Kong)

The 5th dimension will always be the one, because of the fire. We should get a block out of it.

Ok, so, how many streets, the format of it.

It will be: 6 rows, with 3 column in between. It will be cut off in the diagonal starting from the top of the second column (1 row), till the front end of the 3 row.

Now, the street names. That will be a little difficult, because of the mandatory chinese.

1 row: Manhattan St.<br/>
2 row: Star St.<br/>
3 row: Sky St.<br/>
4 row: Bike St.<br/>
5 row: Sparkle St.<br/>
6 row: Water Field St.<br/>
<br/>
1 column: 1th<br/>
2 column: 2th<br/>
3 column: 3th<br/>
4 column: 4th<br/>
5 column: 5th
