# Manhattan (Hong Kong)

The 5th dimension will always be the one, because of the fire. We should get a block out of it.

Ok, so, how many streets, the format of it.

It will be: 6 rows, with 3 column in between. It will be cut off in the diagonal starting from the top of the second column (1 row), till the front end of the 3 row.

Now, the street names. That will be a little difficult, because of the mandatory chinese.

1 row: Manhattan St.
2 row: Star St.
3 row: Sky St.
4 row: Bike St.
5 row: Sparkle St.
6 row: Water Field St.

1 column: 1th
2 column: 2th
3 column: 3th
4 column: 4th
5 column: 5th
